Cognitve Bias Cards Generator
===============================

This scripts create a deck of cards with description of different
cognitive biases. These cards can be used for
[rationality games](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ilw/games_for_rationalists/)
or flashcards.

The description of biases is retrieved from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)
and stored in the file `list.xlsx`. Different colors indicate
different categories of biases:
* green for decision-making, belief, and behavioral biases;
* blue for social biases;
* orange for memory biases.


The generated cards are stored in `allcards.pdf`.
To re-generate the cards use the command
```make all```
